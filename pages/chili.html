            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This chili recipe is my most favorite. It is perfect for a cold 
                winter's day and will leave you feeling cozy and well 
                satisfied. It is made with an Instant Pot, which makes it super 
                simple. Just toss everything in and let the Instant Pot work 
                its magic. The recipe is based on and nearly identical to 
                <a href="https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/instant-pot-chili/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sara Welch's Instant Pot Chili</a> 
                recipe (all credit goes to Sara), found on
                <a href="https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dinner at the Zoo</a>.
                However, I have made some adjustments. I use no olive oil 
                (the meat has plenty of grease for my taste), substitute 
                ground beef for ground bison, use beef bone broth instead of 
                plain beef broth (a little more expensive but worth it IMO), 
                add in a few diced jalapenos, and some Truff brand hot sauce. 
                I usually serve alongside some cornbread muffins. So good 
                together!
