            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is one of my favorites for when you are busy multi-tasking 
                and have a little bit of time to wait. The recipie uses an 
                Instant Pot and it is super quick to just throw everything in 
                then step away to do something else. I would usually make this 
                on a busy day working from home. I could quickly get everything 
                cooking in the Instant Pot during a break, then get back to my 
                work. Dinner would be waiting for me by the time I finished and 
                there would be plenty of leftovers for lunch later in the week!
